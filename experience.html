        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <h4 class="jobs">Education</h4>
          <p>The Iron Yard - Full-Stack Web Development Certificate.</p>
          <p>North Greenville University - B.A. Mass Communications in Print Media. Summa cum laude.</p>
        <h4 class="jobs">Rally Prospecting</h4>
          <p>Creative, agile problem-solver who also led 5 account managers to ensure a seamless client experience. Oversaw development project for our internal email campaign send software, and when the inevitable bugs arose, maintained team morale and client engagement. Managed 3 of our biggest clients and generated ~$20K in revenue through account renewals.</p>
        <h4 class="jobs">Aveda</h4>
          <p>Successful manager of a team of 5 salespeople at a boutique cosmetics brand. Grew sales 10% over previous fiscal year at a $650K sales volume door. Facing apathetic team members, turnover, and shrinking sales, I gradually developed a relationship with the store’s existing assistant manager in order to motivate the team and grow sales ~$42K.</p>
        <h4 class="jobs">The Greenville News</h4>
          <p>Go-to-gal for any support the writers and editors needed at the sports desk. Translated large amounts of scoring data into the newspaper’s CMS. We reported scores for all local high school events; most of this information came to us from coaches via phone or email. I entered in the information I received with accuracy and maintained controlled focus in even the most hectic times.</p>
