        <h2>My Hobbies &amp; Interests</h2>
        <h4 class="jobs">Coding</h4>
          <p>I'm a child of the home computer and internet age. Computers have almost always been part of my daily life. I vividly remember the cow-patterned Gateway box showing up at our door when I was about 6, and I immediately started playing with Paint, and over time found interest in the MS Office suite.</p>
          <p>In high school I developed interest in Apple products and started working with "Paint for Grown-Ups," or the Adobe Creative Suite. This led me to study Print Media in college, and I exceled in my journalism and graphic design studies.</p>
          <p>After several post-collegiate years of dedicated customer care work, I decided to revisit my passion for computers, graphics, and problem-solving through coding.</p>
        <h4 class="jobs">Running</h4>
          <p>If you want to learn a lot about yourself and your work ethic, take up distance running! I can't claim to be crazy about it, but it keeps me fit and helps with focus and discipline.</p>
        <h4 class="jobs">Reading</h4>
          <p>Oh gosh, I am crazy about a good book. I learned to read very young and was into novels by age 7. A couple of my recent favorites are _Seabiscuit_ and _Unbroken_, both by Laura Hillenbrand.</p>
